# Password Validator

The objective of this project is to validate the user passwords and alert him if these passwords are weak. The user inserts the URL of his Facebook profile and this software will analyze it. With this info, a wordlist of the possibles weak passwords will be generated. The user can insert the password he wishes and if it's in this wordlist it means that the password is weak.

# Steps

- [x] Scraping
- [ ] Password generator
- [ ] Validating

# Scraping

First of all the user should insert the URL of his Facebook profile. The Validator will make a web scraping in this link, looking for and list any public info useful as names, address, graduation, movies, sports, etc. To do the scraping the Validator need some libraries, they are:

* mechanize
* requests
* bs4
* pandas

# Password generator

The list of preferences can be used in the tool [Cupp](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp). Cupp generates a wordlist of the possibles passwords, combining keywords, dates and other relevant info generated by scraping. 

# Validating

In the end, the user could insert any password and if it is in the wordlist that isn't a good password.
